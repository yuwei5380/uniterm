## Features

### AI Assistant

Autonomous AI Agent that works like Claude Code — independently plans and executes multi-turn shell commands directly in your terminal.

- **Autonomous Multi-Turn Execution** — The AI Agent can plan, execute, observe results, and iterate across multiple rounds of shell commands without manual intervention.
- **LLM Integration** — Sidebar chat with Anthropic/OpenAI-compatible API, supporting Claude, GPT and other compliant models.
- **Flexible Execution Modes** — Bypass, dangerous only, dangerous + write, or confirm all — you control how much oversight the AI Agent needs.
- **Persistent Conversations** — Chat history is saved per session, so conversations survive app restarts.
- **Terminal Integration** — AI commands execute directly in the active terminal tab, with optional pinning to a specific tab or following your active one. Collaborate side-by-side in split panes, each with its own terminal context.
- **Smart Completion** — While typing in SSH terminals, get real-time suggestions from your command history and AI-powered command rewrites.

### Full-Featured Terminal

Local terminal, SSH / Telnet / Mosh, file transfer (SFTP / FTP), RDP / VNC / SPICE, database, SSH tunnel, server monitor — covering all remote access needs.

- **Remote Terminal** — Supports SSH / Telnet / Mosh. Connect via password or private key authentication; SSH for general remote access, Telnet for legacy/embedded devices, and Mosh for high-latency mobile networks.
- **Local Terminal** — Supports PowerShell / CMD / Git Bash / WSL. Local shells share the same font, color, and behavior settings as SSH sessions.
- **Serial Terminal** — Scan available serial ports and connect with configurable baud rate, data bits, stop bits, and parity. Supports local echo and CR→CRLF normalization.
- **File Transfer** — Supports SFTP / FTP / FTPS / Zmodem. Dual-pane browser for local and remote files. SFTP over SSH; FTP/FTPS with explicit TLS, configurable passive/active mode, and character encoding. Upload, download, drag-and-drop, delete, rename, and more. Transfers tracked per tab with pause, resume, and cancel. SFTP supports max concurrent transfer limit. Zmodem protocol (`rz`/`sz`) supported in SSH terminals, drag-and-drop to upload.
- **Remote Desktop** — Supports RDP / VNC / SPICE. Connect to Windows Remote Desktop, VNC, and SPICE.
- **Database Client** — Connect to MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, and rqlite databases. Execute SQL queries, browse table structures, and edit data rows inline — all from a unified interface.
- **SSH Tunnel** — Port forwarding. Any connection can use an existing SSH connection as a jump host. Auto-assigns local port, tunnels TCP through SSH to the target. Supports all TCP protocol connection types.
- **Server Monitor** — Real-time monitoring for connected servers. View performance metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network), process list with detail panel, listening ports, disk usage with mountpoint info, and network interfaces with bond/bridge detection.

| Category | Protocol | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Terminal | SSH | Remote server shell management |
| Terminal | Telnet | Remote terminal for legacy devices and embedded systems |
| Terminal | Mosh | Server connections over high-latency or intermittent networks |
| Terminal | Serial | Serial port terminal with configurable baud rate and other parameters |
| Terminal | Local | PowerShell, CMD, Git Bash, and other local shells |
| Terminal | WSL | Open installed WSL distributions via local terminal |
| File Transfer | SFTP | Server file management and transfer |
| File Transfer | FTP / FTPS | Website hosting, NAS file transfer |
| File Transfer | Zmodem | In-terminal file transfer via rz/sz commands |
| Remote Desktop | RDP | Windows server remote desktop management (Windows only) |
| Remote Desktop | VNC | Linux server remote control |
| Remote Desktop | SPICE | KVM/QEMU VM management |
| Database | MySQL | MySQL protocol: MySQL, MariaDB, TiDB, and more |
| Database | PostgreSQL | PostgreSQL protocol: PostgreSQL, CockroachDB, and more |
| Database | Oracle Database | Oracle Database connections through a pure Go driver |
| Database | rqlite | Lightweight distributed DB built on SQLite with Raft consensus |
| Monitoring | Monitor | SSH-based real-time CPU, memory, disk monitoring |

Oracle Database support is implemented with a pure Go driver. uniTerm does not bundle Oracle Database, Oracle Instant Client, OJDBC, wallet files, or Oracle brand assets; users are responsible for their own Oracle licenses, credentials, and database access.

### Customization

Connection management, workspace splits, cloud sync, themes — your terminal, your way.

- **Connection Manager** — Save, search, edit, group, and duplicate server connections. Drag-and-drop organization, multi-select or range-select for batch connect, batch delete, and more.
- **Workspace & Split Panes** — Merge terminal tabs into a workspace with horizontal or vertical splits. Drag panel edges or title bars to resize and rearrange freely.
- **Cloud Sync** — Build your own private sync repository via GitHub, GitLab, or Gitee. All configurations (connections, AI model keys, app settings) are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before syncing. Supports automatic sync, conflict resolution, master password changes, and repository management.
- **Themes** — Dark, Deep Blue, and Light themes with automatic system theme detection.
- **Internationalization** — 9-language UI: zh-CN, zh-TW, en, ja, ko, de, es, fr, ru.
- **Cross-Platform** — Built on Wails v2, runs natively on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Quick Workflows

### SSH Connection

1. Click **New Connection** in the Connection Manager
2. Fill in host, port, and authentication (password or private key)
3. Click **Connect** to open an SSH terminal session

### AI Assistant

1. Go to Settings and configure your **AI provider** (API endpoint, model, and key)
2. Open a terminal tab (SSH or local)
3. Open the AI sidebar chat — type your task, and the AI Agent executes commands directly in your terminal

### SFTP File Transfer

1. In the Connection Manager, **right-click** an SSH connection
2. Select **Connect SFTP**
3. Browse, upload, download, and drag-and-drop files in the dual-pane file manager
